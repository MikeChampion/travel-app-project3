# Travel-App

## Description
Has trying to meet up with your family and friends far away been a struggle? Do you wish there was a way for everyone to fill their itineraries so family and friends can coordinate their trips and activities? If the answer is "yes" to both of these questions, then the Travel-App is the perfect solution!

Once a user signs up for the app, the user can fill out an itinerary for their destination and how long their visit will be. From there, the user can submit an activity they are interested in, and fellow travellers can vote on whether or not they are interested in the event.

## Technologies Used
MongoDB, Express, React, Node, Bcrypt, Apollo
